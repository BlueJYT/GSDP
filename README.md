# Github Student Developer Package
A guide on how to get the GSDP (Github Student Developer Package)

Simply go to https://education.github.com/pack and click on "Get Your Pack"

I reccomend you to have your School Email already linked (go here if you haven't https://github.com/settings/emails)

Once you have entered in your information, as long as you have actually entered your school email, it should be a really quick verificaiton, and you can start getting loads of free resources, including Github Pro!

It's a 100% free program, so you should seriously try it out!

If you are having problems, go visit https://support.github.com/ and see if anything there can help! Feel free to drop a comment in the Issues tab if you wish, but I'm not the most qualified to answer your questions.

Good luck!
